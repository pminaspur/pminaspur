### 👨‍💻 About Me :
Welcome to My GitHub! 
I am currently a student at Southern New Hampshire University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. This GitHub Pages account is designed to serve as my digital portfolio for CS-499 and to graduate with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

Throughout my studies, I have had a strong passion for my work. Whether I'm designing aesthetically pleasing front-end interfaces or building reliable back-end systems, each project I engaged in during this program allowed me to craft innovative, sustainable, and meaningful software solutions. The key takeaway here is that good engineers are constantly learning. 

I created this GitHub as a place to document and share my continuous learning and improvement in the ever-evolving world of technology.
